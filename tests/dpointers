BEFORE THE CHANGE OF ADDRESS
the value of x = 100
the address of x given by ptr =  0x7ffee963d478
the address of ptr given by dptr =  0x7ffee963d470
the address of x given by *dptr which tracks ptr =  0x7ffee963d478
the value of x given by **dptr =  100

AFTER THE CHANGE OF ADDRESS
i.e., y = 25; *dptr = &y;

*dptr is  = 0x7ffee963d464
**dptr is =  25
*ptr is  = 25
