README

=== What is this? ===
This is a virtual machine tutorial

THIS ONLY WORKS FOR *UNIX LIKE SYSTEMS -- I.E., LINUX, FREEBSD, AND MACOS.

=== Program is in C ===
git clone and go to the directory:
git clone git@arcelioeperez/virtmachine.git && cd virtmachine

first make `run.sh` an executable with `chmod +x`:
chmod +x run.sh

compile and run with `run.sh`: 
./run.sh

alternatively, compile with `clang` or `gcc`:
gcc main.c
#or 
clang main.c

run:
./a.out

Use `./clear.sh` to remove the `.out` file

=== TEXT EDITOR ===
VI or VIM

=== OS ===
This code was tested on MacOS and Linux (Ubuntu & Manjaro) 

However given that the *nix like systems are somewhat similar you could
also assume that this code runs in FreeBSD as well.
